# TODOList

This is another project of my own. A simple TODO List using jQuery only.
In this project I used Font Awesome to help me create some icons, UI Gradient to make a simple and different background color, and my goal was to develop a TODO List and practice a bit of jQuery.

HTML is pretty simple and everything was used with pure CSS and jQuery.
